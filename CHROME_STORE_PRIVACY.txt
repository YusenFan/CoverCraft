COVERCRAFT AI - CHROME WEB STORE PRIVACY PRACTICES JUSTIFICATIONS
===============================================================================

This document provides justifications for all required permissions and privacy
practices for submitting CoverCraft AI to the Chrome Web Store.

===============================================================================
SINGLE PURPOSE DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================

CoverCraft AI is a cover letter generator that helps job seekers create
professional, tailored cover letters. Users can upload their resume, and the
extension automatically analyzes the current job posting page to extract job
details, then generates a customized cover letter PDF for download.

===============================================================================
PERMISSION JUSTIFICATIONS
===============================================================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. activeTab Permission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To read the content of the current tab when the user clicks the
extension icon.

Justification: The activeTab permission is essential for our core functionality.
When a user clicks the CoverCraft AI extension icon while viewing a job posting
(on sites like LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.), we need to read the page
content to extract job details such as:
- Job title
- Company name
- Job requirements and qualifications
- Company culture information

This permission is only activated when the user explicitly clicks our extension
icon, ensuring we never access page content without user intent. We do NOT
access any pages in the background or without user action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Host Permissions (<all_urls>)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To allow our extension to read job posting pages from any website.

Justification: Job postings exist on hundreds of different websites including:
- Major job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Monster)
- Company career pages (any company's website)
- Startup job boards (Wellfound, AngelList)
- ATS systems (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)
- And many more

Since job seekers apply to positions across all these varied domains, we need
broad host permissions to read job posting content from any site the user visits.
This permission is ONLY used when the user explicitly clicks our extension icon
to generate a cover letter - we never access pages automatically or in the
background.

We also need to make API calls to our backend server at
https://covercraft-ai-ivory.vercel.app/ to process the cover letter generation
using AI.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Scripting Permission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To execute a content script that extracts text content from the
current job posting page.

Justification: The scripting permission allows us to run a small script on the
current page that:
1. Reads the visible text content of the job posting
2. Cleans up the text (removes navigation, ads, etc.)
3. Sends only the relevant job description text to our AI for analysis

This script runs ONLY when the user clicks our extension icon. It does not:
- Modify any page content
- Inject any visible elements
- Run automatically or in the background
- Access any sensitive form data or passwords

The script simply extracts the publicly visible text that the user is already
viewing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Storage Permission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To save user preferences locally on their device.

Justification: We use chrome.storage.local to store:
1. User's preferred output language (English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese)

This improves user experience by remembering their language preference across
sessions. We do NOT store:
- Personal information
- Resume content (processed in memory only)
- Job posting content
- Generated cover letters
- Any data that leaves the user's device

All stored data remains entirely on the user's local device and is never
transmitted to our servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Remote Code / External API Use
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose: To send job posting content and resume text to our AI server for
cover letter generation.

Justification: Our extension requires server-side AI processing because:
1. Cover letter generation uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which requires API access
2. The AI model is too large to run locally in a browser extension
3. API keys must be kept secure on our server, not exposed in client code

Data flow:
1. User uploads resume (processed locally to extract text)
2. User clicks "Generate" button
3. Resume text + job posting text sent to our secure Vercel API endpoint
4. Our server calls OpenAI to generate the cover letter
5. Generated text returned to extension
6. PDF created locally in the browser
7. User downloads the PDF

We do NOT:
- Store user resumes on our servers
- Store job posting content
- Store generated cover letters
- Share any user data with third parties (except OpenAI for generation)
- Use data for any purpose other than generating the requested cover letter

Our API endpoint: https://covercraft-ai-ivory.vercel.app/api/generate

===============================================================================
